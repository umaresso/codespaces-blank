## Inspiration
Web3 is booming. Future is promising with the opportunities Metaverse will bring.<br/>
But NFTs became the cake of rich since they were launched.

Due to tremendous use cases of NFTs like

-   Use in Games **(** sandbox and axie infinity  **)**
-   Attending the Event **(** using them for ticketing **)**
-   Host an Event **(** Host an event on virtual land NFT in metaverse **)**

Eveyone wants to use them but they are expensive.<br/>
Also , if you want to launch your NFT collection on a website aliging with your choice , with nearly no-code,<br/>
you will not find good platforms.

This was a calling moment for us.<br/>
We took the pledge to provide Web3 assets renting in an easy way.

## What it does
We provide services for

-   Creators
-   NFT Holders
-   Developers
-   Users

### Creators
Creators are those who have created an NFT Collection.<br/>
For whitelisting and sale of their collection, we provide **Rentable Dapps** made by the best designers and developers in the space.

### NFT Holders
NFT holders can **Rent their NFTs** for specific time in exchange of some money while still being the owner of them .<br/>
Good way to earn passive income. 

### Developers
They can build a website that does whitelisting and sale of the NFTs <br/>
by interacting with already deployed smart contracts. <br/>
These deployed contracts are dynamic means that same website can be rented for different collections, time after time. 

#### Techical Example

Say we have a website called Nifter.com.This website can perform whitelisting for any collection.<br/>
We can use it for Bored Ape NFTs whitelisting and then after it's rented time is over,<br/>
Same website can be used for whitelisting of others.<br/>
We want you developers to 

**"Build once earn lifetime"**

### Users

Users are People that can borrow NFTs and use them till specific time .

## Challenges we ran into
We faced many but here are few
### Clarity of Project Idea
Not everyone is clear about the project idea so as we.<br/>
Initially we wanted to develop a platform where you can rent websites that are re-usable for different collections.<br/>
But after some time, we had a look at renting NFTs and we have reframed our idea to include it too. 
### Building a Factory version of Contracts
It was difficult for us to form factory versions for whitelisting sale creation and Rentable NFT smart contracts.<br/>
But with the help of stackoverflow and github, we made it. <br/>
Credits are given to the people whose code has helped us in smart contracts generation.
### Ensuring Uniqueness of the Project
Uptil Dapp rent , our idea was really unique.<br/>
But the inclusion of NFT renting made us somehow related to existing projects like reNFT.<br/>
We need to be unique. We tried to ensure uniqueness by using ERC4907 standard. <br/>
We wrote easy to understand well commented smart contracts that are fully transparent. <br/>
Existing projects lack these features.Also , our availability on Tron and Ethereum gave us an edge over others.

### Un-availability of Laptop and Connectivity
One of the team members did not have the laptop and good internet connection.<br/>
He used to borrow laptop from his friends for coding.<br/>
At times he had to sleep at 7 P.M and wake up at 12 A.M to do work<br/>
as laptop was only free from 12 A.M to 6 A.M. But we made it.
### User experience and Decentralization
When we wanted to show available NFTs and Dapps for rent <br/>
we wanted the storage to be decentralized but smart contract performs a bunch of stuff with the records.<br/>
We could load available NFTs from smart contracts but it is a slow process and User Experience might suffer. <br/>
We have achieved both User Experience and Decentralized storage properties with **IPFS and filecoin's web3 storage**.

## RentWeb3 Flow
while writing flow of our project we have to enter images of website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
we have to mention five points of judging criteria <br/>
plus that we have implemented this project for three different Blockchains (tron ,ethereum ,polygon ,tron).

## What we learned
To be added
## What's next for RentWeb3
We are aiming to be the number one marketplace for Renting Web3 assets Globally.<br/>
Currently we are dealing with NFT and Dapp renting that are NFT centered. <br/>
We are implementing their basic features, but in distant future we are aiming to implement <br/>

-   Variety of Dapps to rent
-   APIs to build scalable apps on top of our platform ( composability )
-   More to be added
